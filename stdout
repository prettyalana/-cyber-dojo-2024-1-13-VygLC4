You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given('an input number of {int}') do |int|
# Given('an input number of {float}') do |float|
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

Then('the result is {string}') do |string|
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end
